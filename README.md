## Web Application Programming Assignment 1

### Excercise 1

As part of my Web Development module, this assignment comprises of three excercises. Exercise 1 (named Converter.html), allows the user
to input a range of values and proceses a conversion table from Celcius to Farenheit (or vice versa)

### Exercise 2

For the second exercise (Wordcounter.html), the task was to enable the html file to count the words of another html file. The user inputs the file name at the top of the bar and after clicking the link to open the document, the user can then click another link which will process the already opened window and generate a table of the occurences of words. A sample html file to read is provided called Silly.html

### Exercise 3

For the final exercise (calc.html), we were tasked with programming a calculator that functions using left-right arithmetic. The calculator is supposed to function as much as possible like a standard nom-scientific calculator without the ability to store arithmetic solutions.
